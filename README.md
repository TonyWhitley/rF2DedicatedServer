# rF2DedicatedServer
reverseGrid reverses an rF2 grid by reading the result XML file and writing a batch file that the server or administrator can run

Sample command

`python reverseGrid.py "c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rFactor 2\UserData\Log\Results\2019_04_26_21_27_11-38R1.xml"`

That outputs rgrid which can be run by chatting `/batch rgrid`
